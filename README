Config::File - Parse a simple configuration file

Config::File provides an interface to parse simple -although complete
for most needs- configuration files. The syntax of the configuration
file is as follows:

    # This is a comment
    VALUE_ONE = foo
    VALUE_TWO = $VALUE_ONE/bar
    VALUE_THREE = The value contains a \# (hash). # This is a comment.

Options can be clustered when creating groups:

    CLUSTER_ONE[data] = data cluster one
    CLUSTER_ONE[value] = value cluster one
    CLUSTER_TWO[data] = data cluster two
    CLUSTER_TWO[value] = value cluster two

Then values can be fetched using this syntax:

    $hash_config->{CLUSTER_ONE}{data};

There can be as many sub-options in a cluster as needed.

    BIG_CLUSTER[part1][part2][part3] = data

is fetched by:
    $hash_config->{BIG_CLUSTER}{part1}{part2}{part3};

There are a couple of restrictions as for the names of the keys. First of all,
all the characters should be alphabetic, numeric, underscores or hyphens, with
square brackets allowed for the clustering. That is, the keys should conform
to /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$/

This means also that no space is allowed in the key part of the line.

    CLUSTER_ONE[data] = data cluster one      # Right
    CLUSTER_ONE[ data ] = data cluster one    # Wrong

For further details, please refer to the module's documentation.
